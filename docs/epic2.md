# Epic 2: Calendar Integration

**Goal:** Implement the Motion calendar integration to retrieve and process daily schedule information for the digest email.

**Deployability:** This epic builds upon the foundation established in Epic 1 and implements the core calendar functionality. It can be tested independently once the foundation is in place, but requires the Motion API credentials and configuration from Epic 1.

- Event processing logic
- Timezone handling
- Error handling for API interactions

## Local Testability & Command-Line Access

### Local Development
- Mock Motion API responses for testing
- Local calendar data for development
- Timezone testing utilities
- API rate limit simulation

### Command-Line Testing
- Calendar data retrieval testing
- Event processing validation
- Timezone conversion testing
- API error simulation

### Environment Testing
- Motion API sandbox environment
- Test calendar access
- API credential validation
- Rate limit testing

### Testing Prerequisites
- Motion API access
- Test calendar with sample events
- Timezone testing data
- API documentation reference
